    "### The exponential response formula (ERF) is a quick method for finding the response to any input that is expressible in terms of an exponential, sine, or cosine function. (We will review this method on the next page.) What happens when the input is not one of these?\n",
    "\n",
    "### If the input function $f(t)$ is periodic (of period $2\\pi$), we can express the function (where it is continuous) as an infinite sum of sines and cosines. This series representation is called a ***Fourier series***:\n",
    "## $$ f(t) = c_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left[ a_n \\cos(nt) + b_n \\sin(nt) \\right], \\quad c_0,a_n,b_n\\, \\text{real constants} $$\n",
    "### (Note that here we are giving an expression that only works for $2\\pi$-periodic functions. There is a formula that works more generally, which we will learn later)\n",
    "### The benefit is, given an inhomogeneous linear differential equation $P(D)y=f(t)$, we can apply ERF to every term in the Fourier series.\n",
    "## $$ \\begin{array} {rcl} \\displaystyle  \\text{Input} & \\displaystyle  & \\displaystyle  \\text{Response} \\\\ {\\color{orange}{b_n}}\\sin(nt) & \\displaystyle  \\rightsquigarrow & \\displaystyle  {\\color{orange}{b_n}}y_n^{(s)}(t) \\\\ {\\color{red}{a_n}}\\cos(nt) & \\displaystyle  \\rightsquigarrow & \\displaystyle {\\color{red}{a_n}}y_n^{(c)}(t) \\\\ c_0 & \\displaystyle  \\rightsquigarrow & \\displaystyle  c_1 \\end{array} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Taking the sum of all of the input terms we get an approximation to the input $f(t)$. Therefore by superposition (since our differential equation is linear), the sum of the terms on the right hand side is a series representation of the system response.\n",

    "## Gibbs' Phenomenon\n",
    "\n",
    "### You might be wondering how we can use Fourier series, series composed of continuous functions, to approximate a discontinuous function. While it's true that we can get a Fourier series that converges to a function with discontinuities, the convergence fails at the discontinuities, and near points of discontinuity ***the convergence is very slow*** and very peculiar. Namely, the ***partial sums*** of the Fourier series overshoot and undershoot the values of the function near these points of discontinuity. This is known as the ***Gibbs' Phenomenon***. All discontinuous functions exhibit Gibbs' phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### We illustrate this phenomenon using the example of the square wave of height $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ â€” which we denote by $\\displaystyle S(t) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\operatorname{Sq}(t)$. In this case the discontinuities are at the integer multiples of $\\pi$. The Fourier series for $S(t)$ is\n",
    "## $$ \\begin{array} {rcl} S(t) & = & \\displaystyle \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\operatorname{Sq}(t) = \\sin(t) + \\frac{1}{3}\\sin(3t) + \\frac{1}{5}\\sin(5t) + \\cdots \\\\ \\, & = & \\displaystyle \\sum_{n\\,\\text{odd}}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\sin(nt) \\end{array} $$\n",
    "### For an odd positive integer $N$, write $S_N(t)$ for the $N^{\\text{th}}$ ***partial sum***\n",
    "## $$ S_N(t) \\colon= \\sum_{n\\,\\text{odd}}^{N} \\frac{1}{N} \\sin(nt) $$\n",
    "### Then $S(t)$ is the limit of the functions $S_N(t)$ as $N \\to \\infty$. It turns out that it is possible to do a calculation that's a little bit beyond the scope of this class that for $N$ very large, $S_N$ overshoots $\\displaystyle \\frac{pi}{4}$ (or undershoots ) at a point of discontinuity by about . This overshooting and undershooting can easily be seen in the figures below.\n",
    "![img](img/fourier-2.png)\n",
    "### This overshoot/undershoot by about 9% happens ***always***, not just for the case of $S(t)$, but for any function with discontinuities. In practice, one can only generate approximate Fourier series (with only a finite number of Fourier coefficients, known with some error). Thus the poor convergence of Fourier series for functions with discontinuities â€” and particularly the Gibb's phenomenon â€” creates (serious) difficulties in areas such as signal processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The intuitive reason that the approximation $S_N$ behaves so poorly near discontinuities is that $S_N$ is continuous (it is a finite sum of continuous functions). A continuous function cannot perfectly approximate a discontinuous one. A confusing point, is that even though for $N$ arbitrarily large, the function $S_N$ acts poorly at the discontinuity, the series $\\displaystyle \\sum_{n\\,\\text{odd}}^{\\infty}$ doesn't. This illustrates how limits can act strangely sometimes, as well as the fact that the convergence of $S_N(t)$ to $S(t)$ â€œdoesn't happen in the best possible way\". If you're interested in questions like this, you might find ***18.311*** or ***18.100*** interesting.\n"
