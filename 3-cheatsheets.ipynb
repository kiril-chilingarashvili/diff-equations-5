    "\n",
    "### At a very small scale, this same mechanism, the tendency of the temperature profile toward a straight line equilibrium means that if $\\theta$ is concave down then the temperature in the middle should decrease (so the profile becomes closer to being straight). If $\\theta$ is concave up, then the temperature in the middle should increase (so that, once again, the profile becomes closer to being straight). We write this as\n",

    "### See below a scale model derivation of the Heat Equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### We are going to look at one way to derive a partial differential equation describing the evolution of temperature in an insulated, uniform bar of length $L$. We first looked at this problem in the course Linear Algebra and NxN Systems of Differential equations, when we were studying $n\\times n$ systems. Initially, we considered a rod of length $L$, with two thermometers placed evenly along its length, at the points $x_1=L/3$ and $x_2=2L/3$. The left end of the rod was held at the temperature $\\theta_L$ and the right end was held at $\\theta_R$. We used Newton's law of cooling, which said that the rate of change of temperature at $x_1$, $\\frac{d\\theta_1}{dt}$ is affected by the adjacent temperatures $\\theta_l$ and $\\theta_R$.The left contribution is proportional to the difference in temperature $\\theta_L-\\theta_1$, while the right contribution is proportional to $\\theta_2-\\theta_1$. This meant that we could write down a system of two equations for $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$:\n",
    "## $$ \\begin{array} {rcccl} \\displaystyle \\frac{d\\theta_1}{dt} & = & k(\\theta_L-\\theta_1)+k(\\theta_2-\\theta_1) & = & k(\\theta_L-2\\theta_1+\\theta_2) \\\\ \\displaystyle \\frac{d\\theta_2}{dt} & = & k(\\theta_1-\\theta_2)+k(\\theta_r-\\theta_2) & = & k(\\theta_1 - 2\\theta_2+\\theta_r) \\end{array} $$\n",
    "### We were a little careless when we first looked at this system. Looking more carefully, we can see that if we want to place many thermometers on the bar and track the interaction of temperatures at many points, then we should adjust the constant $k$ for the distance between points. Let's suppose that we place $N$ thermometers at points $x_n=n\\Delta x,\\, n=1,\\ldots,N$ equally spaced along the bar, with $\\displaystyle  \\Delta x = \\frac{L}{N+1}$. If $\\theta_n(t)$ is the temperature at $x_n$, then the correct scaling for the influence of $\\theta_{n+1}$ and $\\theta_{n-1}$ on $\\theta_n$ is the following version of Newton's law:\n",
    "## $$ \\frac{d\\theta_n}{dt} = \\nu \\frac{(\\theta_{n-1}-\\theta_n)}{(\\Delta x)^2} - \\nu \\frac{(\\theta_n-\\theta_{n+1})}{(\\Delta x)^2} $$\n",
    "### In other words, $k=\\nu/(\\Delta x)^2$ is the appropriate scaling for $k$, with $\\nu$ a property of the material. (This inverse square law is what Fourier discovered by testing bars of metal of various lengths. He then applied the insight that calculus brings, namely that the same rule should work at infinitesimal scales.) We can now simplify the right hand side to obtain\n",
    "## $$ \\frac{d\\theta_n}{dt} = \\nu\\frac{(\\theta_{n+1}-2\\theta_n+\\theta_{n+1})}{(\\Delta x)^2} $$\n",
    "### We want to consider the limit $N\\to\\infty$ so that $\\Delta x\\to 0$. We are interested in deriving a partial differential equation for the temperature $\\theta(x,t)$ at any position $x$ along the bar. We therefore need to choose $n$ so that $x_n\\to x$ as $N\\to\\infty$. A possible choice is $n=\\left\\lfloor x/\\Delta x\\right\\rfloor=\\left\\lfloor x(N+1)/L \\right\\rfloor$. As $N\\to\\infty$, the right hand side of the equation for $\\displaystyle \\frac{d\\theta_n}{dt}$ becomes $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial x^2}(x)$. In this limit, we have the following partial differential equation describing the continuous evolution of temperature in the bar:\n",
    "## $$ \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{dt} = \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial x^2} $$\n",
    "### This is the heat equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The heat equation does not determine the solution completely by itself. We also need to specify what are known as ***boundary conditions*** and ***initial conditions***.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ***Boundary conditions*** are the temperatures at the two ends of the rod at each time. For example, we can impose the boundary conditions that temperature is fixed for all time on the left and right sides at given temperatures:\n",
    "## $$ \\theta(0, t) = \\theta_L, \\quad \\text{and}\\quad \\theta(L,t) = \\theta_R $$\n",
    "### ***The initial condition*** can be any smooth function $\\theta_0(x)$ so that\n",
