Because if we hold the beam further and further from the point where the mass is hung, we not only have to apply a vertical shear force, but the further away our point of contact, the force also creates a torque, and the beam must supply a resultant torque (or ***bending moment*** as it is called in the mechanics of beams) to prevent the beam from rotating.\n",
