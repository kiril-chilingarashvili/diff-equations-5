    "\n",
    "### If the input function $f(t)$ is periodic (of period $2\\pi$), we can express the function (where it is continuous) as an infinite sum of sines and cosines. This series representation is called a ***Fourier series***:\n",

    "### (Note that here we are giving an expression that only works for $2\\pi$-periodic functions. There is a formula that works more generally, which we will learn later)\n",
    "### The benefit is, given an inhomogeneous linear differential equation $P(D)y=f(t)$, we can apply ERF to every term in the Fourier series.\n",

    "\n",

This is more forgiving at discontinuities. Remarkably, there is a correct notion of closest, and it is the integral of the difference of the functions quantity squared that is minimized.\n",

    "## Gibbs' Phenomenon\n",
    "\n",
    "### You might be wondering how we can use Fourier series, series composed of continuous functions, to approximate a discontinuous function. While it's true that we can get a Fourier series that converges to a function with discontinuities, the convergence fails at the discontinuities, and near points of discontinuity ***the convergence is very slow*** and very peculiar. Namely, the ***partial sums*** of the Fourier series overshoot and undershoot the values of the function near these points of discontinuity. This is known as the ***Gibbs' Phenomenon***. All discontinuous functions exhibit Gibbs' phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### We illustrate this phenomenon using the example of the square wave of height $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ — which we denote by $\\displaystyle S(t) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\operatorname{Sq}(t)$. In this case the discontinuities are at the integer multiples of $\\pi$. The Fourier series for $S(t)$ is\n",
    "## $$ \\begin{array} {rcl} S(t) & = & \\displaystyle \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\operatorname{Sq}(t) = \\sin(t) + \\frac{1}{3}\\sin(3t) + \\frac{1}{5}\\sin(5t) + \\cdots \\\\ \\, & = & \\displaystyle \\sum_{n\\,\\text{odd}}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\sin(nt) \\end{array} $$\n",
    "### For an odd positive integer $N$, write $S_N(t)$ for the $N^{\\text{th}}$ ***partial sum***\n",
    "## $$ S_N(t) \\colon= \\sum_{n\\,\\text{odd}}^{N} \\frac{1}{N} \\sin(nt) $$\n",
    "### Then $S(t)$ is the limit of the functions $S_N(t)$ as $N \\to \\infty$. It turns out that it is possible to do a calculation that's a little bit beyond the scope of this class that for $N$ very large, $S_N$ overshoots $\\displaystyle \\frac{pi}{4}$ (or undershoots ) at a point of discontinuity by about . This overshooting and undershooting can easily be seen in the figures below.\n",
    "![img](img/fourier-2.png)\n",
    "### This overshoot/undershoot by about 9% happens ***always***, not just for the case of $S(t)$, but for any function with discontinuities. In practice, one can only generate approximate Fourier series (with only a finite number of Fourier coefficients, known with some error). Thus the poor convergence of Fourier series for functions with discontinuities — and particularly the Gibb's phenomenon — creates (serious) difficulties in areas such as signal processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The intuitive reason that the approximation $S_N$ behaves so poorly near discontinuities is that $S_N$ is continuous (it is a finite sum of continuous functions). A continuous function cannot perfectly approximate a discontinuous one. A confusing point, is that even though for $N$ arbitrarily large, the function $S_N$ acts poorly at the discontinuity, the series $\\displaystyle \\sum_{n\\,\\text{odd}}^{\\infty}$ doesn't. This illustrates how limits can act strangely sometimes, as well as the fact that the convergence of $S_N(t)$ to $S(t)$ “doesn't happen in the best possible way\".
